mall project demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. This project will cover key OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The project will simulate a simple library system.

1. Library System Overview
We will create a library system with the following classes:

Book
Member
Library
Main (to test the functionality)

2.class defination (Book.java)
3.Member.java
4.Library.java
5.Main.java

Explanation
Encapsulation: The Book and Member classes have private fields and public methods to access and modify these fields.
Inheritance: While this example does not explicitly show inheritance, you can easily extend these classes for more specific types of books or members.
Polymorphism: This could be demonstrated by creating a method that takes a List<Book> or List<Member> and processes them, relying on the common interface.
Abstraction: The Library class abstracts the management of books and members, providing methods to borrow and return books.
