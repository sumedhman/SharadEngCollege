small project in Java that demonstrates the concept of inheritance. 
We will create a simple system for managing different types of employees in a 
company. The project will involve the following classes:

Employee - The base class
Manager - A subclass of Employee
Developer - Another subclass of Employee
Main - To test the functionality
-----
Explanation
Inheritance: Manager and Developer classes inherit from the Employee class. 
This means they automatically get the fields and methods defined in Employee.
Polymorphism: Each subclass (Manager and Developer) can override methods from the Employee class 
to provide specific functionality.
Encapsulation: Each class encapsulates its fields and provides public getter and setter methods
to access and modify them.
